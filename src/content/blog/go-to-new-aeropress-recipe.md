  My go-to Aeropress recipe whenever I'm craving some filter coffee.
---
I just got back home from my student exchange programme in Korea, where I brought my trusty AeroPress with me to brew some coffee using beans from various coffee roasters around Korea. I thought it'll be fun to share the go-to recipe I've been using during the past 4 months!

### Overview
- Paper filter
- Inverted method

### Coffee
- 15g 
- Medium/dark roast

### Water
- 200ml
- 100Â°C

### Grind settings
- Finer end of medium
- 8 clicks on my Timemore C3 Pro

### Steps:
1. Boil some water.
2. Put paper filter into the cap and wet the filter using some hot water.
3. Assemble AeroPress and put it in the inverted position.
4. Grind coffee beans and pour them into the AeroPress.
5. Pour 50ml of water to bloom and use a spoon to stir.
6. After 30s, pour the remaining 150ml of water, give it a final stir and put on the cap.
7. Squeeze out the remaining air while AeroPress is inverted.
8. Around the 3 minute mark, place a mug on top of the AeroPress, invert and start plunging.
9. Enjoy your cup of coffee!

I've recently taken a liking to the inverted method, since it allows for longer extraction of the coffee grounds, resulting in a richer and fuller flavour. One just has to be careful when inverting the AeroPress, so you wouldn't make an entire mess.

I hope you'll enjoy this recipe and make a delicious cup of coffee with it ðŸ˜„
